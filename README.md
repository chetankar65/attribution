# attribution

This utility  is used to create credits / attribution / license informaiton documentation of any software that uses open source code. 

The input to this utility is the Black Duck report (just the components.csv file).
Please generate a CSV report of your black duck project. Download the ZIP file. 
Unzip it and you will find the "componentXXXXXXX.csv" file. That will become input to this 
utility. 

The output is an HTML file which can be uploaded as the credits / attribution page.
